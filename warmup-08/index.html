       <p>

            This is my website design. At the top of the page, there is a pink-colored nav section with a logo on the left side,
            and a Home, About, and Contact page navigation button. Each of these words will have padding
            around them realtive to the lines seperating the words. The lines will be created by putting each word 
            in inline-blocks.

            <br />
            <br />

            Next is the site title and the photo beneath it. The site title will have a healthy all-around margin
            around it, as well as a 50% border-radius around it with a solid black border. It will also be positioned
            at the left side of the page using absolute positioning.

            <br />
            <br /> 
            
            The photo beneath the site title will have a smaller margin around it, as well as smaller padding. Much like the rest of the page,
            it will have some margin to the left of it to give it space from the edge of the page. It will also
            have a pseudo-elemnt attatched to it where if you hover over the image, a text box will roll down from the 
            top of the photo, complete with information about the photo. This is illustrated by the post it note in Image 2.
            The photo will also have a solid black border around it. 
            
            <br />
            <br />

            Underneath the photo, the body text of the page will reside. It will have a large margin on either side
            of the writing, and will then be positioned toward the left of the page using absolute positioning, so that the nav bar on the right has room to extend.
            
            <br />
            <br />

            At the bottom of the page, there will be another pink-colored nav section with a hyperlink on the right designed to
            send the viewer back to the top of the page. This will essentially just be a hyperlink directed to the page itself,
            thus refreshing the page. It will have a small margin all around it, then will be text-aligned to the right of the nav bar. 
            
            <br />
            <br />

            Lastly, there will be a nav bar on the right of the page. It will extend out from the right of the page when the three
            bars at the top of the page are clicked. This will be created using a pseudo-elemnt allowing text to roll out from the right
            when the bars are clicked. The extended bar will have a logo at the top of it, with links to different pages of the website all the 
            way down the nav bar. At the bottom of the nav bar will be a company copryright, depending on whose back it will be. Everything will be
            text-aligned to the center of the extended nav bar, with margins around each link & the logo.
