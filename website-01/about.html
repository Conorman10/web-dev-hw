        Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was one of the major English romantic poets.
        While Percy was alive, he wasnt very famous. 
        It wasn't after his death that his peoms began to recieve major acclaim from critics and fans alike.
        Percy's life was marred with bad luck, including the death of his first wife, Harriet Westbrook, in 1816.
        Because of her death, and because of Percy's defience of social conventions, he locked himself into permanent self-exile in Italy in 1818.
        There he create some of his best works, including the poem "Ozymandias", which he wrote in 1818.
        Percy died in a boating accident in 1822, further emphasizing his bad luck.
