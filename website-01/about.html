        Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792-1822) was one of the major English romantic poets.<br />
        While Percy was alive, he wasnt very famous.<br /> 
        It wasn't after his death that his peoms began to recieve major acclaim from critics and fans alike.<br />
        Percy's life was marred with bad luck, including the death of his first wife, Harriet Westbrook, in 1816.<br />
        Because of her death, and because of Percy's defience of social conventions, he locked himself into permanent self-exile in Italy in 1818.<br />
        There he create some of his best works, including the poem "Ozymandias", which he wrote in 1818.<br />
        Percy died in a boating accident in 1822, further emphasizing his bad luck.<br />
