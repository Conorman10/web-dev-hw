        <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
        <h4>By Percy Bysshe Shelley</h4>

        I met a traveller from an antique land<br />
        Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
        Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,<br />
        Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
        And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
        My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br />
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
        Nothing beside remans, Round the decay<br />
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
        The lone and level sands stretch far away."
