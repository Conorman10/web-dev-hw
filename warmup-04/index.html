                    If only there could be another way to do this
                    <br />
                    'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
                    <br />
                    I know I always said that I could never hurt you
                    <br />
                    Well, this is the very, very last time I'm ever going to
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But I know that I'll be happier
                    <br />
                    And I know you will too
                    <br />
                    Said, I know that I'll be happier
                    <br />
                    And I know you will too
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
                    <br />
                    Eventually, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
                    <br />
                    'Cause if I was never in your life
                    <br />
                    You wouldn't have to change it
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    And it's got to be soon
                    <br />
